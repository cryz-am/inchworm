# inchworm
Inchworm was a project I completed in Robotics for my Junior Year. A small robot was able to use a photosensor and wiskers to navigate the world around it. Although inchworm had no greater artificial intelligence the algorithm it used was enough to accomplish what it needed to without major delay. 
Inchworm was coded using Arduino and exectued on an Arduino Uno with an extension board (added a breadboard). 
Again, this was an assignment and not an independent project, but the code I wrote was not guided and is still a good example of both competence in Arduino and understanding of the relationship between hardware and software.
